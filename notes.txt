definition if only two are 
mentioned it means top and right 
and the other two will be given 
values according to top and 
bottom so here since only left 
and right is there we use 0 for 
top and bottom 
values 

/** Links **/ 
/** if you specify only two top 
details are applied to bottom and 
right details specifications are 
applied to left **/

margin auto it brings things into center
